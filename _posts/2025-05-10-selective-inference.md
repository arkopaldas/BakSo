# Advances in Selective Inference Methods

In this post, I'd like to share some recent advances in selective inference methods that I've been exploring in my research. Selective inference is becoming increasingly important as we deal with complex data-driven analyses in fields like mobile health.

## What is Selective Inference?

Selective inference addresses the challenges that arise when:

1. We use the same data to select which hypotheses to test
2. And then use that same data to test those selected hypotheses

This creates a problem because traditional statistical methods don't account for this selection process, leading to inflated false positive rates and incorrect conclusions.

## Recent Developments

In our recent work with Professor Snigdha Panigrahi and Walter Dempsey, we've been exploring novel approaches to selective inference for effect modification in mobile health contexts. 

The key innovations include:

- Conditional inference techniques that account for the selection process
- Methods that control false discovery rates in adaptive experimental designs
- Computationally efficient algorithms for high-dimensional selective inference

## Applications in Mobile Health

These techniques have promising applications in mobile health interventions, where we want to:

1. Identify which intervention components are most effective
2. Determine for whom specific interventions work best
3. Optimize timing of interventions based on contextual factors

Our JASA submission "Selective Inference for Effect Modification: Applications in Mobile Health" explores these applications in detail.

## Future Directions

Moving forward, I'm particularly interested in exploring how these selective inference techniques can be combined with advanced machine learning methods, particularly in contexts where we have time-varying and high-dimensional features.

Stay tuned for more updates on this exciting area of research!
