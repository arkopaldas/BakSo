  <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  <p>My research interest lies in the interface of theoretical machine learning and statistical inference. I am interested in creating and implementing innovative statistical techniques for inference after adaptive modeling of data. Currently, my research focuses on developing and applying selective inference methods for time-varying effect modification problems.</p>
